    <h2>Host Guidebook</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Before the session
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure the Luma sign-up exists
            <ul>
              <li>Generally we try to keep sessions to ~20 people</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Be mindful of participant diversity, actively reach out to people who you think should be there at
            Playspace</li>
          <li>Make sure you have *some* sort of snacks/food
            <ul>
              <li>Venmo request @playspace for reimbursement :)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Make sure venue is confirmed</li>
          <li>Make sure you know who is cohosting that week!
            <ul>
              <li>Have only two main cohosts, everyone else on the host roster should be fully in participant mode and
                should feel like they can be fully present enjoying the session</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Setup for the session
        <ul>
          <li>Come up with a question of the day! It should be a little whimsical but also give good threads for people
            to have follow up conversations on
            <ul>
              <li>Here's a <a
                  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/edit">good
                  starting point</a>!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Up to the host as to how to split the intro circles
            <ul>
              <li>Generally, it's good to do something that splits up groups of people who come together; we want people
                to mingle and make new friends!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>During the session
        <ul>
          <li>Always hard-start 15min after stated start time</li>
          <li>Intro + Intro circles
            <ul>
              <li>It's nice to tag-team this with the two cohosts</li>
              <li>Generally we recommend a structure of:
                <ul>
                  <li>What is Playspace</li>
                  <li>What does Playspace mean to you</li>
                  <li>Logistics of the working blocks</li>
                  <li>Logistics of the space (e.g. restrooms, food, wifi, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Send off into intro circles (generally aim for ~10 people per circle)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Designing the space
            <ul>
              <li>Space matters! It changes how people choose to show up</li>
              <li>Prefer cozy places like homes and art/community spaces over corporate offices and coworking spaces
              </li>
              <li>Have a silent working room for people who really want to dial in for serious work</li>
              <li>Be on top of the noise-level; it should be generally library level silence during focus blocks</li>
              <li>[tbd] designing for louder activities? e.g. if people want to collaborate or play instruments</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>During breaks
            <ul>
              <li>Encouraging people to show-and-tell! Show that it's low-stakes and that even in-progress things are ok
              </li>
              <li>Making a welcoming environment for new folks. Making sure they aren't hanging out in a corner alone!
              </li>
              <li>[tbd] its actually very hard to have a good number of good convos with people to feel like you can get
                around to everyone, how do we do this well?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Show-and-tell + Scrapbook
            <ul>
              <li>Gather folks around to contribute to the <a href="https://scrapbook.playspace.club/">scrapbook</a>!
                It's a great way to encourage people to come back week after week and see the progress and also to
                connect with others</li>
              <li>After giving people 5min to contribute to the scrapbook, gather people around for show and tell. There
                are many ways to run this!
                <ul>
                  <li>Some people like to organize it by intro circle so theres many show-and-tell circles and
                    *everyone* gets to demo. Downside of this is that you don't get to see what people in other groups
                    did</li>
                  <li>Other times, we have big group show and tell where we ask people to come up and demo to the group.
                    This works well if you've spent some time during break talking to people and have an idea of
                    projects/people you'd like to highlight! This is more effort on the cohosts though :&#39;)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Aim for show and tell to last 30-40min with ~8 demos</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After the session
        <ul>
          <li>Cleanup the space! Engage participants and ask them to help
            <ul>
              <li>Good chance for people to talk to each other while helping out :)</li>
              <li>After everything is clean, its a good way to start signaling the 'end' of the event so people can
                leave or go elsewhere to continue talking</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have a short handoff meeting between the hosts. Should be short meeting (3-5min) after cleanup
            <ul>
              <li>What went well today?</li>
              <li>Who is cohosting next week?
                <ul>
                  <li>What do they need help with?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>What didn't go well today that we want to change for next week?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
